# sdkjs — Euro-Office JavaScript SDK

Guidance for AI agents working in **sdkjs** — the Euro-Office JavaScript SDK for the document
editors. This is the canonical instruction file; `CLAUDE.md` points here.

## What this repo is

sdkjs is the client-side engine for five document editors: **word** (text documents),
**cell** (spreadsheets), **slide** (presentations), **pdf** (viewer/annotator/editor), and
**visio** (diagrams). It is a hard fork of `ONLYOFFICE/sdkjs`, rebranded to Euro-Office, and
still periodically syncs from upstream (`git.onlyoffice.com`).

It is **not** an npm package. The build concatenates+minifies the sources into per-editor
bundles (`sdk-all.js` / `sdk-all-min.js`) that the sibling **web-apps** repo loads via
`<script>` tags. sdkjs lives in a multi-repo workspace alongside `web-apps` (the UI/toolbars),
`core` (the C++/WASM engine, fonts, x2t converter), `server`, and `DocumentServer`. Licensed
**AGPL v3** (GUI assets are CC-BY-SA 4.0).

## Repository layout

| Path        | Purpose |
| :---------- | :------ |
| `common/`   | Shared, editor-agnostic engine: base API, history/undo, co-editing, drawings, charts, fonts, formatting (DrawingML), serialization. Everything below depends on it. |
| `word/`     | Text-document editor + document model (`Editor/`), drawings, math, native overrides (`Local/`). |
| `cell/`     | Spreadsheet editor: `model/` (workbook + formula engine), `view/` (rendering), `graphics/`. |
| `slide/`    | Presentation editor + themes/textures. |
| `pdf/`      | PDF editor; `src/` is the implementation, `build/` a compiled wrapper, `test/` a harness. |
| `visio/`    | Diagram editor with its own VSDX serialization (`model/`). |
| `build/`    | Webpack build: `webpack.*.mjs`, `scripts/`, `lib/` (shared env/config helpers), `loaders/` (`sdk-concat.cjs`), `test/` (build-tooling unit/integration tests), `package.json`, `license.header`. Run npm from **here**. See `build/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md` for the full workflow. |
| `configs/`  | `<editor>.json` file-lists that drive the build (load order); `externs.json` for Closure. |
| `tests/`    | QUnit suites per editor + `code-style/check.py` (the lint gate). |
| `vendor/`   | Third-party libs (jQuery, XRegExp, etc.). Excluded from lint/build minification. |
| `tools/`    | One-off Python maintenance scripts (color schemes, SVG cursors). |

## Build & develop

For Docker dev environment setup (running the full server stack), see [/DocumentServer/AGENTS.md](../DocumentServer/AGENTS.md).

Requires **Node.js** only — the build now runs on Webpack + Terser (no Java, no Google
Closure Compiler). There is **no root `package.json`**; all build deps live in `build/`.
See `build/DEVELOPER-GUIDE.md` for the full workflow (watch mode, source maps, cache).

```bash
# Full SDK build (release; all 4 modules in parallel, ~50s cold / ~2-3s warm). Run from build/.
cd build && npm ci && npm run build
# Outputs: ../deploy/sdkjs/{word,cell,slide,visio}/sdk-all-min.js + sdk-all.js
```

```bash
# Debug/dev loop — no bundling. Run from build/.
npm run develop              # writes ../develop/sdkjs/<editor>/scripts.js listing the
                              # individual source files, so editors/tests load unminified sources
COMPILED=1 npm run develop   # same manifest, but pointing at the compiled bundles
```

Day-to-day inner loop: edit a source file → `npm run develop` → reload the editor/test page.
You only need the full `npm run build` (webpack) to produce release/min bundles, or
`npm run watch:word` (etc.) for an auto-rebuilding dev bundle.

Config is via **environment variables**, not CLI flags: `SDK_PLATFORM=desktop` or `mobile`
(desktop/mobile-only files), `SDK_SOURCE_MAPS=1` (source maps on a production build),
`SDK_ADDONS=../../sdkjs-forms` (`path.delimiter`-separated list; merges external addon repos'
`configs/`), `NODE_ENV=development` (readable, unminified output). There is no `--level`
CLI flag anymore — minification is always Terser, but `webpack.sdk.factory.mjs` still
distinguishes desktop/mobile from web: `SDK_PLATFORM=desktop`/`mobile` sets Terser's
`compress: false` (closer to the old `WHITESPACE_ONLY` tier), while web builds keep
`compress` on (closer to `ADVANCED`, minus mangling). `mangle: false` is load-bearing on
every platform (see Gotchas below).

**`make` is NOT the SDK build.** The Makefile's default target also builds the sibling
`../web-apps` repo and requires it to be checked out next to sdkjs; it is the integration
build. Use `npm run build` in `build/` for SDK-only work. (The Makefile's `SDKJS_FILES` is also
stale — it lists only `word/sdk-all.js` though the build produces all editors.)

### Adding a source file

There are **no ES modules and no tree-shaking** — files are plain scripts concatenated in the
order listed in `configs/<editor>.json`. A new `.js` is invisible to the build until you add it
to the right array inside the top-level `sdk` object in the config (`sdk` → `min` = core engine
→ `sdk-all-min.js`; `sdk` → `common` = the rest → `sdk-all.js`; also `desktop`, `mobile`,
`exclude_mobile`). There is no flat key called `sdk.min` — grep for `"min":` inside the `sdk`
block. Order matters: dependencies must appear before dependents (e.g. `apiCommon.js`
before `api.js`).

## Tests

QUnit suites run headless via `node-qunit-puppeteer`, **from the repo root**:

```bash
# one-time setup (from repo root)
npm install node-qunit-puppeteer
npm ci --prefix build
SDK_ADDONS=../../sdkjs-forms npm run --prefix build develop

# run the whole suite (exits non-zero on failure)
node tests/runAll.js

# run a single suite
node node_modules/node-qunit-puppeteer/cli.js tests/word/api/api.html 30000 "--no-sandbox"
```

CI (`.github/workflows/check-build.yml`, `ubuntu-latest` runners, not self-hosted) runs the
whole suite via the aggregate runner (`node tests/runAll.js`) in its `unit-tests` job. Suites
that can't pass yet are listed with reasons in `skippedTests` at the top of `tests/runAll.js`,
not silently dropped.

**CI branch scope:** `check-build.yml` triggers on push and pull_request for `main`, `fork`,
`develop`, `release/**`, and `hotfix/**` — PRs targeting `main` are CI-guarded by this workflow.

Heaviest coverage is in `tests/cell/spreadsheet-calculation/` (formula engine) and
`tests/word/`. Suites depend on the generated `develop/sdkjs/*/scripts.js`, so run
`npm run develop` (in `build/`) first.

## Code style — the build-breakers

The **only** enforced lint gate is `python tests/code-style/check.py` (run from repo root).
ESLint config (`.eslintrc.yaml`) exists but is **not** wired into CI. `check.py` checks every
`.js`/`.cjs`/`.mjs` file (outside `vendor/`, `externs/`, `node_modules/`, `.webpack-cache/`) —
the `.cjs`/`.mjs` extensions cover the build-tooling scripts added by the webpack migration
(`build/scripts`, `build/lib`, `build/loaders`). `check.py` fails the build if such a file does
not:

1. contain either the AGPL header string `Copyright Ascensio System` **or** an
   `SPDX-License-Identifier` header (the new build-tooling files use SPDX headers only),
2. contain the literal `LV-1050`,
3. use LF line endings (no CRLF), and
4. end with a trailing newline.

⚠️ **Known divergence:** the Euro-Office fork removed the `LV-1050` Latvian address from *every*
header. `check.py`'s Latvian-address check (`check_file_without_latvian_address`) still exists
in the script but its call in `main()` is commented out, so **`check.py` does not fail on a
clean checkout** — the address requirement is dormant, not enforced. Don't "fix" this by
re-adding `LV-1050` to files; match the existing header (which omits it), and don't
uncomment the call either, since that would fail every file in the repo.

Every source file starts with the AGPL block (copy an existing file's header verbatim), then:

```js
"use strict";
(function(window, undefined)
{
	// ... module body ...
})(window);
```

Conventions to follow:

- **Globals, not modules.** Publish symbols onto window namespaces, assigning **both**
  `window['Name'].Sym = window.Name.Sym = Sym` (bracket form survives Closure minification).
- **Naming:** public editor methods `asc_*` (e.g. `asc_getCanUndo`); property accessors
  `get_X` / `put_X` (plain methods, not real JS properties); enums/constants `c_oAsc*`
  (in `apiDefines.js` / `commonDefines.js`); internal classes `C`-prefixed (`CDocument`,
  `CColor`). Events fire via `this.sendEvent('asc_onXxx', ...)`; listeners via
  `asc_registerCallback`.
- **Indentation: tabs.**
- Never hand-edit generated artifacts: `deploy/.../sdk-all*.js` and
  `develop/sdkjs/*/scripts.js` are build output.

## Architecture notes

### Global namespaces (set on `window`)

| Namespace | Meaning |
| :-------- | :------ |
| `Asc` | Public editor API, enums, error codes, `asc_*` classes. The editor singleton is `Asc.editor` (and `window.editor`). |
| `AscCommon` | Shared engine: `baseEditorsApi`, History, `TableId`, collaborative editing, utilities. |
| `AscFormat` | OOXML DrawingML / shared formatting & drawing types (shapes, fills). |
| `AscDFH` | Change/history factory (`AscDFH.changesFactory[...]`, history-point descriptions). |
| `AscCommonWord` / `AscWord` | Word document-model internals. |
| `AscCommonExcel` | Spreadsheet model (workbook, cells, `cFormulaFunction` map). |
| `AscPDF` / `AscViewer` | PDF internals and the render/viewer layer. |
| `AscMath` | Equation engine. |
| `AscFonts` | Font system. |
| `AscDesktopEditor` | Bridge to the native desktop app (present only in desktop builds). |

### Per-editor API layers

Each editor dir has the same set of API files:

- `api.js` — the editor client API class (`asc_docs_api` for word/slide, `spreadsheet_api`
  for cell, `PDFEditorApi`, `VisioEditorApi`). Extends `AscCommon.baseEditorsApi` via
  `Object.create(...)`. These are large files (word/cell `api.js` are 10k–16k lines).
- `apiBuilder.js` — the **Document Builder** API (`Api*` classes, JSDoc-heavy, `get_/put_`
  accessors). Server-side / scripting surface, distinct from `api.js`. Wrapped in
  `(function(window, builder){...})`.
- `api_plugins.js` + `plugin-events.js` (+ `common/base-plugin-events.js`) — the plugin API
  and event typedefs.
- `fromToJSON.js` — serialization helpers + unit converters (MM/EMU/Twips/Px); note it also
  holds utilities like `private_GetLogicDocument()`.
- `apiDefines.js` — editor-specific `c_oAsc*` constants.

### Shared engine (`common/`)

- **Undo/redo & change tracking:** every document mutation creates a change object
  (`AscDFH.changesFactory`) recorded in `History` (`HistoryCommon.js`). `TableId.js` is an
  object registry mapping string IDs → document objects; required for both undo/redo and
  co-editing (changes reference objects by ID, not pointer).
- **Co-editing:** `docscoapi.js` (WebSocket transport) + `CollaborativeEditingBase.js` +
  `collaborativeHistory.js`. PDF reuses Word's collab model (`pdf/src/CollaborativeEditing.js`
  extends `CWordCollaborativeEditing`).
- **Drawings/Charts/Format:** large subsystems under `common/Drawings/`, `common/Charts/`,
  plus the `AscFormat` types — shared by all editors for shapes, charts, images.
- **Cell formula engine:** parser in `cell/model/FormulaObjects/parserFormula.js`; functions in
  the `AscCommonExcel.cFormulaFunction` map; recalculation orchestrated in `cell/model/Workbook.js`
  (`wbModel` = data model, `wb` = `WorksheetView` render/controller).

## Gotchas

- The editor instance lives in both `Asc.editor` and `window.editor` (desktop compat) — code
  often checks both.
- External callers must use bracket access (`window['Asc']['asc_docs_api']`); public names are
  still published both ways (`window['Name'].Sym = window.Name.Sym = Sym`) as a defensive
  convention, but the current webpack build runs Terser with `mangle: false` — property/name
  mangling is not actually applied. Keep using bracket access anyway; don't rely on this as
  license to switch to dot-access-only code.
- `make` pulls in `../web-apps`; for SDK-only work use `npm run build` in `build/`.
- Use `npm ci` (not `npm install`) in `build/` to respect the committed `npm-shrinkwrap.json`.
- No Java/Closure Compiler dependency anymore — `npm run build` and `npm run develop` both only
  need Node.js.

## Where future findings live

This file is orientation-only — keep it small. Long-tail findings (edge-case behaviours,
subsystem quirks, debugging recipes) belong in the findings store described in issue **#51**
(frontmatter docs + derived index + local vector DB cache). Once #51 lands, that store is the
canonical home; add new discoveries there, not here.
